- Four days a week, 18 weeks total.
- Weeks 1-9: base phase.
- Weeks 10-18: peak phase.



PROGRESSION

Last set of the main movement of each day is an AMRAP.

To determine the increase in weight for the main lift: take the last week's weight lifted, and add 1% of your 1RM for each extra rep you did on last week's AMRAP.

For example:
- 1RM: 100kg
- Last week's AMRAP target: 6+
- Last week's actual AMRAP reps: 10
- Total weight increase this week: (10 - 6)% of 100kg = 4% of 100kg = 4kg.



DEVELOPMENTAL EXERCISES

Second exercise of each day corresponds to a developmental variation of the antagonist movement w.r.t. the first exercise of the day.
