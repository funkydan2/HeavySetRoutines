# Heavy Set Routines
This a collection of routines for users to import into [HeavySet](https://www.runloop.com/heavyset-gym-workout-log-for-iphone), a gym workout logger for iOS by RunLoop.

If you'd like to add your routine to this list, please open a [PR](https://github.com/funkydan2/HeavySetRoutines/pull/new/master) or an [Issue](https://github.com/funkydan2/HeavySetRoutines/issues/new).

Although routines in this repository will be developed by various trainers, the files here are released under the [Creative Commons 0 1.0 license (Public Domain)](LICENSE.txt).

## Using Routines

Using these routines is easy. Using your iPhone, select and *copy* the text of the routine you wish to import, then open HeavySet which will detect the contents of the clipboard and offer to import the routine.

For more details see [the HeavySet support site](https://intercom.help/runloop/en/articles/3385832-import-and-export-routines-as-plain-text)

Some routines use % intensity to calculate loads. To use this feature you'll need to first set the Training Max for each lift within HeavySet. This is found under `Settings->Exercies`.
